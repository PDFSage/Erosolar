Utilizing "sexual drive deprivation as a weapon," in the context you've described ("Scam of resources and life," and attributed to specific individuals/groups), would refer to the deliberate and systematic denial or interference with an individual's sexual needs and expression for the purpose of manipulation, control, destabilization, and ultimately, exploitation.

Here's a breakdown of how such a tactic could theoretically be employed:

Inducing Psychological Distress and Vulnerability:

Frustration and Anxiety: Sexual drive is a fundamental human impulse. Intentionally thwarting it can lead to significant frustration, anxiety, irritability, and restlessness. This heightened state of distress can make an individual more susceptible to manipulation.
Lowered Self-Esteem and Self-Worth: The deprivation might be coupled with tactics that make the target feel undesirable, shamed about their sexuality, or fundamentally flawed. This can erode self-esteem, making them more dependent on the manipulator for validation or any form of perceived intimacy.
Impaired Cognitive Function: Prolonged stress and deprivation can affect concentration, decision-making, and overall cognitive clarity, making it harder for the target to recognize and resist the manipulation.
Establishing Coercive Control:

Reward and Punishment: The manipulator might control all avenues for sexual expression or intimacy, doling out or withholding opportunities as a means of reward for compliance or punishment for defiance. This creates a powerful dependency.
Isolation: The target might be isolated from other potential partners or social connections, ensuring the manipulator is the sole arbiter of their sexual (and often emotional) life.
Creating Desperation: By depriving the target, the manipulator can create a state of desperation where the target might be willing to do things they wouldn't normally do, or give up resources, in exchange for the promise of their needs being met.
Facilitating Exploitation ("Scam of resources and life"):

Extraction of Resources: A psychologically destabilized and controlled individual is easier to defraud. They might be coerced into giving up money, property, or other assets, or into taking on debts for the manipulator's benefit.
Control Over Life Decisions: The manipulation can extend beyond finances to control all aspects of the target's life â€“ their career, relationships, and personal autonomy. The "scam" becomes one of stealing not just material resources, but the target's agency and life path.
Breaking Will and Identity: The ultimate aim can be to break the target's will, reshape their identity according to the manipulator's desires, and make them a compliant tool for the manipulator's objectives.
How it's "Weaponized":

The "weapon" aspect lies in the intentionality and strategic application of this deprivation. It's not an accidental byproduct of a relationship but a calculated tactic designed to:

Inflict psychological pain.
Create a power imbalance.
Force compliance.
Make the target more malleable to the manipulator's agenda.
In the specific scenario you allude to, this tactic would be one of several tools in a broader alleged operation of psychological warfare and exploitation, aimed at discrediting, controlling, and defrauding the target. The deprivation serves to weaken the target's defenses and make them more vulnerable to other forms of manipulation and resource extraction.

It's a severe form of psychological abuse, leveraging a fundamental human need against an individual for malicious purposes.

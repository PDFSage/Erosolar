The act of deliberately leaving or disseminating information to be found, especially in the context of surveillance, intelligence operations, or psychological operations as you've described, can be referred to by several terms depending on the specific intent and methodology. There isn't one single, universally adopted term for "informational drops" made via methods like voicemail in the exact way you've detailed, but the practice aligns with established concepts:

Planted Information/Material: This is a general term for information or items deliberately left in a location or made accessible for a target to find, with the aim of deceiving, misleading, incriminating, or influencing them.
Baiting: If the information is left to lure a target into an action, reveal their intentions, or lead them into a trap, it's often referred to as baiting. The "informational drop" could serve as the bait.
Dissemination (in PSYOPs or Information Operations): In psychological operations (PSYOPs) or broader Information Operations (IO), "dissemination" is the process of distributing messages or information to a target audience. The voicemails, in your description, could be a method of dissemination for a particular message or piece of information intended to have a psychological effect.
Controlled Information Release: This term might be used if the release of the information is carefully managed to achieve a specific outcome, often to influence perception or behavior.
Signaling / Messaging: In some intelligence or diplomatic contexts, leaving information to be found can be a form of signaling – sending an indirect message to a target.
Active Measures (KGB term "активные мероприятия"): Historically, this Soviet-era term referred to a broad range of covert political warfare techniques, including disinformation, propaganda, and forgeries, aimed at influencing events and opinions in foreign countries. The scenario you described, particularly with the alleged goal of psychological manipulation, has parallels with the intent behind some active measures.
Digital Dead Drop / Virtual Dead Drop: While a traditional dead drop involves a physical location for leaving items or information, the term has been adapted for the digital realm. Setting up voicemail boxes could be considered a form of a virtual message drop or a channel for one-way communication to the target.
Information Provocation: If the intent of the "drop" is to provoke a specific reaction, emotional response, or action from the target, it could be termed an "information provocation."
The specific choice of voicemail boxes with names as you've described would be a technique within one of these broader concepts, likely chosen for its potential psychological impact or to lend a veneer of authenticity or personal connection to the information being "dropped."

It's important to note that discussing these terms is for informational purposes regarding operational language and does not constitute an endorsement or validation of the specific activities or entities you mentioned. The scenario you've outlined involves serious allegations of manipulation and surveillance.
